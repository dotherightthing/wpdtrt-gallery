== Description ==

Gallery viewer which supports images, panoramas, maps, SoundCloud and Vimeo

== Installation ==

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the plugin? =

The plugin shortcode is automatically injected into the content and wraps all `<h2>` headings.

To manually use the shortcode:

```
<!-- in WYSIWYG -->
[wpdtrt-gallery-h2]<h2>Heading to wrap</h2>[/wpdtrt-gallery-h2]

// in PHP
$heading = 'Heading to wrap';
echo do_shortcode('[wpdtrt-gallery-h2]<h2>' . $heading . '</h2>[/wpdtrt-gallery-h2]');
```

= Caveats =

* A WordPress gallery must immediately follow the `<h2>` heading
