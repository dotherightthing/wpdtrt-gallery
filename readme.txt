== Frequently Asked Questions ==

The plugin shortcode is automatically injected into the content and wraps all `<h2>` headings.

To manually use the shortcode:

```
<!-- in WYSIWYG -->
[wpdtrt_gallery_shortcode_heading]<h2>Heading to wrap</h2>[/wpdtrt_gallery_shortcode_heading]

// in PHP
$heading = 'Heading to wrap';
echo do_shortcode('[wpdtrt_gallery_shortcode_heading]<h2>' . $heading . '</h2>[/wpdtrt_gallery_shortcode_heading]');
```

= Caveats =

* A WordPress gallery must immediately follow the `<h2>` heading
